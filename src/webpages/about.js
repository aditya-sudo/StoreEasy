            Many a times we find people going on-site or moving to some other
            city for a certain period and they don’t get a safe and secure place
            to keep their belongings that they can’t carry along. They end up
            either selling their belongings at a lower price or just give it to
            someone free of cost. When they return, resettlement requires high
            investment in terms of time, money and effort.
          </p>
