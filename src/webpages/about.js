            Many a times we find people going on-site or moving to some other city for a certain period and they don’t get a safe and secure place to keep their belongings that they can’t carry along. They end up either selling their belongings at a lower price or just give it to someone free of cost. When they return, resettlement requires high investment in terms of time, money and effort.</p>
